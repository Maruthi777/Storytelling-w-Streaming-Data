# Storytelling-w-Streaming-Data

DESCRIPTION:-

This application streams data from open-notify.org. The data streamed is about the current location of the International Space Station. It includes the current latitude and longitude positions of the International Space Station. 

Though the International Space Station moves at a very fast speed, we poll every 5 seconds so that there is noticeable difference in the latitude and longitude.

According to the latitude and longitude obtained, we then determine over which country the International Space Station is currently located. If it is is over no country, we print International Waters.

The below screenshot displays the final result of the project i.e, displaying timestamp, latitude and longitude of the International Space Station on the webpage as list items.
